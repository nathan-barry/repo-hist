Explore the history of a GitHub repository, viewing its commits, associated files, and the content of individual files, all with a sleek, user-friendly interface. Start from the first commit and explore all the way to the present.

Built entirely with Go for front end and back end. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling and HTMX for AJAX-like partial page updates without needing JS. Only external dependency is godotenv which is only for local testing.
